# RandomMatlab
A collection of MatLab programs from my past.

- This is a collection of all my MatLab work from a few different courses at
  LSU. They are different programs and algoritms for solving different equations
  such as different decompositions and some matrix math. If you are curious to
  what these may do individually you can contact me at rshoul2@gmail.com.

- You will need MatLab to use these programs in any sort of way but any text
  editor will be able to open them and view their contents.
